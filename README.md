## My notes
through this task we learned about basic authentication and autherization we did that by creating a sign up and sign in end point. The sign up end point where the user can create a username and password which the user can then go to the sign in endpoint enter the info created we verify them and if valid it gives okay and if not returns a respose to notify for the error that has occured.
